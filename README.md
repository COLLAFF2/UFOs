## :boom: Overview :boom:
    The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth look into the UFO sightings webpage by allowing the user to filter through multiple criteria at the same time. The user will be able to filter by date, city, state, country, and shape.
    This will be done by using html, bootstrap, css, and js.

## :boom: Results :boom:
    * After the new filters were applied we can link into the updated webpage with the link provided above.
    * Once on the new webpage you can locate the filter search on the lefthand side of the page.
   ![filter search](static/images/filter%20search.png)

   * The  user can now search on different criteria. They can choose date, city, state, country, and or shape. Someone can choose only one filter or a combination of multiple or all filters.
   * Once the  search criteria is entered, the results will pop up in the table to the right.

## :boom: Summary :boom:

### :satr: Sites Drawback :star:

    * Although it is easy to navigate this webpage it is limited to the data in our data.js file that only covers January of 2010.
    * Also if we are limiting our dataset to just January of 2010 why have date as a filter?

### :star: Recommendations :star:

    * The webpage could use a larger dataset to make it more useful to the user. 
    * I would recommend not having the date as a filter becuase it is more limiting to an already limited dataset.
